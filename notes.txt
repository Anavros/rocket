TODO:
- Improved key reporting that shows modifiers, non-alphabetical characters, etc.
- Less complex callback system for clearer stack traces?
- Better handling of index buffers so gloo import is not needed.
- Attach function that takes names and args and doesn't just infer from function
name.
- Optional argument to get coordinates in world space instead of pixel space.
- Sequential screenshot function, as well as auto-named screens.
- Timer to fire held-key events less often than once per frame.

Features:
- Create a window.
- Launch an internal loop that uses callbacks.
- Register event callbacks.
- Load glsl shaders.

Desired:
- Run a window without taking control flow.
- Manually process events without callbacks, or use an external callback system.
- C bindings that are similar to python bindings.
- Resizable windows with auto-readjusting aspect ratio?
